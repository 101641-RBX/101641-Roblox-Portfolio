Developing on Roblox since December 2022. I have been on Roblox since 2009 and have a big history with this game. Graduated with Associates in Computer Science August 2025, pursuing Bachelors. Folders attached to this repository will go over the different areas I have done scripting, including examples.
Currently pursing software engineering as a degree.

# Notice

Keep in mind I do have a IRL job and college, so while I can still complete stuff in a resonable time, delays can occur.

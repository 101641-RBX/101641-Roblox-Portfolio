# 101641 Roblox Portfolio

Developing on Roblox since December 2022. I have been on Roblox since 2009 and have a big history with this game. Folders attached to this repository will go over the different areas I have done scripting in, as well as show examples.


# Experience Rundown
Below you can find a quick rundown of what I have experience in coding:
- Programming tools, weapons, objects

- Programming Basic Gameplay (Teams, spawning, etc,)

I also have done a light amount of work in the following fields, mostly for placeholder purposes for my code:

# Description
SCP Battlefront is a solo project I started working on in 2023, it is currently unfinished but I do plan on restarting it again. I started this project over a year ago when I was getting more accustomed to coding, and looking back I am proud of just how much work I committed by myself given my knowledge.
The plan was to make this game have a SCP theme, but with Star Wars Battlefront 2 gameplay. There were plans to have a story campaign, SCPS, factions, MTF reinforcements, etc.
Of course it was a little too ambitious given my knowledge so it did leave me stepping back. I haven't touched this project in over a year but I would love to come back and finish it given my current knowledge.

**All GUI's, animations, and scripting (NPCs, guns, tools, etc etc) were done by me.**

**Gun models, morphs, and sounds were not created by me (I kit-bashed a bunch of UGC's)**

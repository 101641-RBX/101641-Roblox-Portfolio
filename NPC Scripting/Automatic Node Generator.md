# Automatic Node Generator

This is a script that automatically generates nodes horizontally along a part. These nodes are used for NPC's to move to them.

The reason I decided to use nodes is due to the diversification of pathfinding, as it forces AI to move to pre-set areas, instead of all of them following a single path that regular pathfinding would generate.

The AI does pathfind to these nodes, which means they will move around obstacles to reach it.

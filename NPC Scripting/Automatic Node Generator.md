# Scripting Overview

## Description
This script generates parts called "Nodes" that will be placed at fixed intervals on top of the main part. To prevent endless generation of the nodes, cutoffs are generated at the corners and front/back of the main part, which when reached will force the script to start generating further down the main part. This works for all part sizes, as well as all rotation.

# Description
SCP Battlefront is my 2nd big project I started working on, it is currently unfinished but I do plan on restarting it again. I started this project over a year ago when I was getting more accustomed to coding, and looking back I am proud of just how much work I committed by myself, given my knowledge.
The plan was to make this game have a SCP theme, but with Star Wars Battlefront 2 gameplay. There were plans to have a story campaign, SCPS, factions, MTF reinforcements, etc.
Of course it was a little too ambitious given my knowledge so it did leave me stepping back for a bit, but given my current coding knowledge I can easily come back and restart this.

**All GUI's, animations, and scripting (NPCs, guns, tools, etc etc) were done by me. Keep in mind this was over a year ago**
